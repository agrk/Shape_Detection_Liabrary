# Shape_Detection_Liabrary

In this project we will work on creating a shape recognition library. The image given as an input to the code and list of the shapes that we want to have on the image will be given (circle, rectangle, triangle, pentagon ...). A color value will be assigned to each shape, as output, the shapes will be painted in this colors and the names of the shapes will be written in them.

Qt Creator will be used as the development enviroment and C++ will be used as programming language. As a library, we will get help from OpenCV
